This folder contains files that are in a private repository. 
The projects are in C or C++ and are mainly centered around understanding tasks of the Operating System such as Memory Management (Heap Manager), Booting (How OS is initialized by bootloader), architecture of a Filesystem and how to read and write files (Linux ext2 Filesystem), and most importantly how OS controls concurrency using a Scheduler and functions such as thread_lock(), unlock(), signal(), etc. to run multithreaded programs(Thread Library).
